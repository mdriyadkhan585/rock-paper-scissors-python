1. **Getting the Computer's Choice:**
   ```python
   def get_computer_choice():
       return random.choice(['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors'])
   ```
   - Uses the `random.choice` function to select a random choice for the computer.

   def determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice):
       # Compares choices and prints the result
   ```
   - Compares player and computer choices and prints whether the player won, lost, or tied.

3. **User Input and Validation:**
   ```python
   player_choice = input("Your choice: ").capitalize()
   ```
   - Prompts the user to enter their choice and capitalizes the input to match the expected format.

4. **Formatted Output:**
   - Displays user and computer choices, and announces the result in a clear and engaging format.
